Thank you for wanting to contribute!

## Guidelines

- **Align with project vision:** If unsure, propose changes in an issue or discussion first.
  - Bridge Neovim and `opencode`'s TUI — not replace the latter.
  - Simple, intuitive UX.
- **Add more value than maintenance burden**
  - Prefer simple, robust solutions.
  - Consider edge cases and existing project patterns.
  - Core functionality should be widely useful — not hyper-specific.
- **High-quality Pull Requests**
  - Fill out the PR template.
  - Review any AI-generated code yourself.
