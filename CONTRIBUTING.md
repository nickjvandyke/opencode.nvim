## Contributing to `opencode.nvim`

Thank you for wanting to contribute!

I maintain this in my free time — please expect and allow for variable response times and lengths 🙂

<sup>or sponsor me so I can sustainably spend more time on it 😄</sup>

## Guidelines

- **Align with project goal**
  - Integrate Neovim with `opencode`'s TUI to enable novel functionality first, and convenience second.
  - Simple, intuitive UX.
  - If unsure, propose changes in an issue or discussion first.
- **Add more value than maintenance burden**
  - Prefer simple, robust, and general solutions.
  - Consider existing project patterns and edge cases.
  - Heavily weighed when re-implementing TUI features.
- **High-quality Pull Requests**
  - Fill out the PR template.
  - Review any AI-generated code yourself.
  - Address any automated PR comments (some are incorrect, I know.)
